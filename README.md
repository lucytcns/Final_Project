### Introduction
For thousands of years, people have been studying the dry and rainy seasons for agricultural planning and urban and rural construction. However, the time period of the dry and rainy season has always changed. We believe that certain weather terms determine the dry and rainy season. Therefore, we want to analyze the factors that affect the changes in the rainy and dry seasons. We list the factors related to the dry and rainy seasons as variables: humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and temperature.

According to the topic, we have two following questions from time and place as starting points:

For different locations at a fixed time, what is the difference between the dry and rainy seasons in different areas? In order to avoid little difference between the dry and rainy seasons in the same climate region, we choose cities in five different climate regions in the United States from 2016 to 2020: Sacramento, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, Denver, and Indianapolis.

For fixed location at different times, is there any difference between the current and the past dry and rainy seasons? We choose Sacramento as the location for this question, and observe and compare the dry and rainy seasons of 1976-1980 and 2016-2020 Sacramento.
